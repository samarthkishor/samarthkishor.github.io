      <title>The Role of Open Source in Health</title>

      <description>This is my eighth blog post for the UVA class LPPS 4720.
Academic research is critical for the advancement of medical science, yet many of the most prestigious journals are locked behind insurmountable paywalls. Open Access (OA) journals seek to combat this by bringing the principles of open-source to academia&amp;mdash;they are completely free and open to the public so that anyone with an Internet connection can access quality medical research. OA also limits many copyright and licensing restrictions, similar to the spirit of Creative Commons licenses, so that the health community can freely build upon each other&amp;rsquo;s work.</description>

      <title>The Role of Open Source in Infrastructure</title>

      <description>This is my seventh blog post for the UVA class LPPS 4720.
There are two major types of infrastructure that power the Internet: decentralized and centralized. While open-source software can live on both centralized and decentralized infrastructure, I believe that the future of the Web will rely on distributed computing over a decentralized network of computers. Open-source is key to making this work effectively.
As I mentioned in my previous post Tim Berners-Lee envisioned the World Wide Web as a primarily decentralized platform.</description>

      <description>This is my sixth blog post for the UVA class LPPS 4720.
In this post I&amp;rsquo;m going to get a bit meta and talk about open-source blogs on my open-source blog on open-source. For someone who wants to start writing online, there are really two options&amp;mdash;use some sort of centralized publishing platform like Medium or go the decentralized route and build and host the website yourself (or use a service like GitHub Pages to host the site for you).</description>

      <title>The Role of Open Source in Agriculture</title>

      <description>This is my fifth blog post for the UVA class LPPS 4720.
When you think of farming, you probably picture massive fields with acres of land and tons of heavy equipment. However, not all food needs to be grown this way&amp;mdash;individuals can empower themselves to manage their own small-scale farming operations. Unlike companies such as Vision Robotics and Naio Technologies that develop and sell proprietary farming robots, FarmBot is a company completely built upon open-source principles&amp;mdash;they sell products, but everything, including the building instructions for the robots and the software that they run on, is fully open-source.</description>

      <title>The Role of Open Source in Education</title>

      <description>This is my fourth blog post for the UVA class LPPS 4720.
Education is a cornerstone of modern society and is vital to the success of future generations. This means that everyone should have access to a quality education regardless of their background or socio-economic status. Open Source has the potential to revolutionize and democratize education by reducing the costs of necessary materials such as textbooks (replaced with online open-access books) and software (use LibreOffice instead of MS Office, Inkscape and GIMP instead of PhotoShop, Linux instead of Windows or macOS, etc.</description>

      <title>The Role of Open Source in Energy</title>

      <description>This is my third blog post for the UVA class LPPS 4720.
The purpose of this assignment probably was to discuss how the Open Source movement will impact renewable energy, but I&amp;rsquo;m going to take this in a different direction and talk about computer chips. RISC-V is the first completely free and open CPU instruction set architecture (ISA) primarily for low-energy computers. According to its website, &amp;ldquo;the RISC-V ISA delivers a new level of free, extensible software and hardware freedom on architecture, paving the way for the next 50 years of computing design and innovation&amp;rdquo;.</description>

      <title>The Role of Open Source in Addressing Inequality</title>
      <link>https://samarthkishor.github.io/posts/open_source_inequality/</link>

      <description>This is my second blog post for the UVA class LPPS 4720.
Inequality manifests itself in many different ways, but I will only address one of these in this post: access to information. The 21st century, the so-called &amp;ldquo;Information Age&amp;rdquo;, is a time where connection to the Internet along with basic literacy enables an unprecedented number of people to freely participate in the &amp;ldquo;Human Colossus&amp;rdquo;. However, even with the Internet, the abuse of strict intellectual property laws can restrict free access to information and perpetuate inequality.</description>

      <title>The Role of Open Source in Innovation and Product Development</title>

      <description>This is my first blog post for the UVA class LPPS 4720.
While Intellectual Property (IP) has been a useful tool in the past to foster entrepreneurship, it has many underlying issues. An Open Source philosophy is a great alternative to IP which solves many of its issues, but still is not a silver bullet. To understand the advantages of Open Source when applied to innovation and product development, it is important to first understand IP.</description>

      <title>Typed APIs in Python with dataclasses and NamedTuples</title>
      <link>https://samarthkishor.github.io/posts/typed_apis_in_python/</link>

      <guid>https://samarthkishor.github.io/posts/typed_apis_in_python/</guid>
      <description>Why would Python programmers ever care about types? While Python doesn&amp;rsquo;t check any types statically (before running the program), it does perform extensive run-time type checking. Checking types at run-time without any implicit casts makes the language strongly-typed and dynamically-typed, as opposed to a language like C which is weakly-typed and statically-typed. This is an important distinction, but I won&amp;rsquo;t go over the differences between strong and weak typing in this post.</description>

      <title>Three Completely Different Approaches to the FizzBuzz Problem</title>
      <link>https://samarthkishor.github.io/posts/fizzbuzz_approaches/</link>

      <guid>https://samarthkishor.github.io/posts/fizzbuzz_approaches/</guid>
      <description>Here&amp;rsquo;s a solution to the classic infamous FizzBuzz problem in Python:
for i in range(1, 31): if i % 15 == 0: print(&amp;#34;FizzBuzz&amp;#34;) elif i % 3 == 0: print(&amp;#34;Fizz&amp;#34;) elif i % 5 == 0: print(&amp;#34;Buzz&amp;#34;) else: print(i) 1 2 Fizz 4 Buzz Fizz 7 8 Fizz Buzz 11 Fizz 13 14 FizzBuzz 16 17 Fizz 19 Buzz Fizz 22 23 Fizz Buzz 26 Fizz 28 29 FizzBuzz This program is really simple and is probably the most common approach.</description>

      <title>Remote Linux Process Hacking through SSH</title>

      <description>There&amp;rsquo;s this really cool process hacking series on YouTube by Keist Zenon. He uses the programming language Common Lisp to interact with processes on his Linux machine. I tried following the tutorial on my Mac, but macOS does not have the same ptrace commands and system call interfaces as Linux so this did not work out. However, I have VirtualBox set up on my Mac with a Debian VM which I use whenever I need Linux.</description>

      <title>Interactive OCaml Development</title>

      <description>Interactive development features are mostly found in dynamically-typed interpreted programming languages like Python or JavaScript. While OCaml is a statically-typed compiled language, it is still possible to program in an interactive style using a REPL. However, OCaml will never be quite as flexible and interactive as something like Lisp because of its greatest feature: the strong static type system.
Testing functions using the REPL One of the nicest features of OCaml is that is has both a byte-code compiler (ocamlc) and a native-code compiler (ocamlopt).</description>
